# minishell

A POSIX-like shell written in C, with a web-based terminal GUI.

```
Browser (xterm.js)  ←──WebSocket──→  Node.js server  ←──PTY──→  minishell (C)
```

## Features

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Pipelines | `ls \| grep .c \| wc -l` — up to 64 segments |
| I/O redirection | `>` `>>` `<` — works inside pipelines too |
| Background jobs | `sleep 10 &` — shell reaps them at each prompt |
| Variable expansion | `$VAR` `${VAR}` `$?` `$$` |
| Tilde expansion | `~/foo` → `/home/user/foo` |
| Command history | 500-entry ring buffer, deduplicated |
| Built-ins | `cd` `exit [n]` `history` `export` `unset` |

## Quick start

### 1. Build the shell

```bash
make          # produces ./minishell
```

### 2. Install GUI dependencies

```bash
cd gui
npm install
```

`node-pty` compiles a native addon — you need `python3`, `make`, and a C++
compiler. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential python3`.
On macOS Xcode Command Line Tools are enough.

### 3. Run

```bash
# from the gui/ directory
# Use the absolute path to minishell (or it won't spawn correctly in the PTY)
# Note: Use WSL Node.js directly to avoid Windows npm issues
SHELL_BIN={pwd}../minishell /usr/bin/node src/server.js
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. You should see a terminal
running your minishell.

### What is a PTY?

A pseudoterminal (PTY) is a kernel-level abstraction that makes a process
believe it is talking to a real terminal, even though it is not. It has two
sides:

- **Master** — held by `node-pty`. Reads output, writes input.
- **Slave** — given to `minishell` as its stdin/stdout/stderr. The shell sees
  it as a normal terminal device (it can check `isatty()`).

The kernel's *line discipline* sits between them. It handles:
- Echoing characters back to the screen
- Translating `\r` to `\r\n` (carriage-return newline)
- Sending `SIGINT` when Ctrl-C is pressed
- Sending `SIGTSTP` when Ctrl-Z is pressed
- `SIGWINCH` when the window is resized

This is why minishell needs no changes at all — it just reads from stdin and
writes to stdout, exactly as it would in a real terminal.

### Resize flow

When the browser window changes size:

1. `ResizeObserver` fires
2. `fitAddon.fit()` recalculates `term.cols` and `term.rows` to fill the DOM element
3. `terminal.js` sends `{ type:"resize", cols, rows }` over the WebSocket
4. `server.js` calls `shell.resize(cols, rows)` on the PTY
5. The kernel sends `SIGWINCH` to `minishell`
6. The shell's `readline` (or your own logic if you handle it) redraws

### Multiple sessions

Each browser tab that opens `ws://localhost:3000/terminal` gets its own
WebSocket connection → its own `pty.spawn()` call → its own independent
shell process. No shared state.

## Building for production

```bash
# Serve over HTTPS (required for wss://)
# Set PORT and SHELL_BIN, put behind nginx/caddy for TLS.
PORT=8080 SHELL_BIN=/usr/local/bin/minishell node src/server.js
